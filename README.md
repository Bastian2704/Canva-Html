# Fun with HTML5 Canvas

This challenge introduced me to the HTML5 Canvas API, allowing me to experiment with interactive drawing using JavaScript.
The result is a colorful drawing canvas where the stroke changes color and thickness dynamically as you draw.

# Technologies Used

HTML5 – Canvas element

CSS – Basic styling
