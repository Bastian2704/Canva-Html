# Fun with HTML5 Canvas

This challenge introduced me to the HTML5 Canvas API, allowing me to experiment with interactive drawing using JavaScript.
The result is a colorful drawing canvas where the stroke changes color and thickness dynamically as you draw.
Also I used other video that uses CSS variables, and used it here for my text

# Technologies Used

HTML5 – Canvas element

CSS – Basic styling

JavaScript (Canvas API) – Interactive drawing logic
